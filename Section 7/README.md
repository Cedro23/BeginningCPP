# Section 6 - Arrays and Vectors <a name="section_7"></a>
## Characteristics of Arrays
- Fixed in size
- Elements are all the same type
- Stored contiuously in memory
- Individual elements can be accessed by their position or index

- First element is at index 0
- Last element is at index size-1

- No checking to see if you are out of bounds

- Always initialise arrays
- Very efficient
- Iteration (looping) is often used to process arrays 

## Why do we use them ? 
Suppose you have to model 100 test scores. Modeling each one of them as its own variable with its own name can quickly get out of control. You now have to keep track of 100 variable names.

Now with an array of 100 integers, you now only have 1 name to remember !

This is a typical use case for arrays.
